                The cupcake’s story begins in the 19th century, when home bakers in America started 
                baking small portions of cake batter in cups to save time and measure ingredients easily. 
                These “cup cakes,” as they called, baked faster and cooled quickly — 
                making them favorite treat for families and gatherings.

                As baking became more creative, cupcakes turned into miniature works of art. 
                Frostings, sprinkles, and colorful liners transformed the simple cake into a dessert full of personality. 
                In the early 2000s, bakeries around the world made cupcakes iconic — 
                blending elegance, nostalgia, and playfulness into every bite.
